# jDFA
Java data flow analysis framework by M. Mohnen using BCEL 6.1

This is a repository of the jDFA code written and referenced by Markus Mohnen in the paper:
"An Open Framework for Data-Flow Analysis in Java" from the journal Principals and Practice
of Programming in Java, 2002

The original source from SourceForge used references to the original library that manipulated
Java bytecodes, which has been superceded by the BCEL library.  This version has all references
to the original library changed to use the current BCEL library (http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-bcel)
thus enabling the usage of the examples and functions created by this seminal work.
